# emotion-recognition
Emotion recognition from facial images using convolutional neural networks.

## Classifiers
Resnet, VGG-16, and Onsunet convolutional neural network architectures are used.

## Libraries
PyTorch, TensorFlow libraries are used to implement convolutional neural networks. Each architecture has two variants for each libary.

PySide is used to provide graphical user interface to application.

## Datasets
FER2013, KDEF, and CK+ datasets are used to train classifier. Each dataset is processed in both PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries.

## Execution of the application
To execute the application, it is enough to run main.py file.

```
py main.py
```
